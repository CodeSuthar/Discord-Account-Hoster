## Is it safe?
Yes, it is safe to use. This account hoster is made using `discord.js-selfbot-v13` which is a selfbot package modified from base `discord.js` v13 package which is widely used by develoopers and is available online at this [github repository](https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/discord.js-selfbot-v13)
